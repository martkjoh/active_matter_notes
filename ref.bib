	abstract = {We present a large-scale numerical study{,} supplemented by experimental observations{,} on a quasi-two-dimensional active system of polar rods and spherical beads confined between two horizontal plates and energised by vertical vibration. For a low rod concentration Φr{,} our observations are consistent with a direct phase transition{,} as bead concentration Φb is increased{,} from the isotropic phase to a homogeneous flock. For Φr above a threshold value{,} an ordered band dense in both rods and beads occurs between the disordered phase and the homogeneous flock{,} in both experiments and simulations. Within the size ranges accessible{,} we observe only a single band{,} whose width increases with Φr. Deep in the ordered state{,} we observe broken-symmetry ``sound'' modes and giant number fluctuations. The direction-dependent sound speeds and the scaling of fluctuations are consistent with the predictions of field theories of flocking; sound damping rates show departures from such theories{,} but the range of wavenumbers explored is modest. At very high densities{,} we see phase separation into rod-rich and bead-rich regions{,} both of which move coherently.},

@article{Chen_Lee_Toner_2016,
	abstract = {Active fluids and growing interfaces are two well-studied but very different non-equilibrium systems. Each exhibits non-equilibrium behaviour distinct from that of their equilibrium counterparts. Here we demonstrate a surprising connection between these two: the ordered phase of incompressible polar active fluids in two spatial dimensions without momentum conservation, and growing one-dimensional interfaces (that is, the 1+1-dimensional Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation), in fact belong to the same universality class. This universality class also includes two equilibrium systems: two-dimensional smectic liquid crystals, and a peculiar kind of constrained two-dimensional ferromagnet. We use these connections to show that two-dimensional incompressible flocks are robust against fluctuations, and exhibit universal long-ranged, anisotropic spatio-temporal correlations of those fluctuations. We also thereby determine the exact values of the anisotropy exponent ζand the roughness exponents χx,y that characterize these correlations.},

@article{denk2020pattern-induced,
	abstract = {Propelled agents that align their orientations upon collisions can give rise to macroscopic order. Depending on the details of the agents{\textquoteright} collisions, this ordering process can lead to spatiotemporal patterns, including traveling polar waves and nematic lanes. Recent experiments suggest that such patterns can also coexist and dynamically interconvert. Here we propose a general mechanism for such a phenomenology, which is based on patterned-induced local symmetry breaking. We show that macroscopic order in active-matter systems is linked to spatiotemporal density patterns, which in turn can lead to local symmetry breaking if the agent density exceeds the relevant threshold values. Our study sheds light on the principles of pattern formation and the emergence of symmetry in biological active-matter systems.The emergence of macroscopic order and patterns is a central paradigm in systems of (self-)propelled agents and a key component in the structuring of many biological systems. The relationships between the ordering process and the underlying microscopic interactions have been extensively explored both experimentally and theoretically. While emerging patterns often show one specific symmetry (e.g., nematic lane patterns or polarized traveling flocks), depending on the symmetry of the alignment interactions patterns with different symmetries can apparently coexist. Indeed, recent experiments with an actomysin motility assay suggest that polar and nematic patterns of actin filaments can interact and dynamically transform into each other. However, theoretical understanding of the mechanism responsible remains elusive. Here, we present a kinetic approach complemented by a hydrodynamic theory for agents with mixed alignment symmetries, which captures the experimentally observed phenomenology and provides a theoretical explanation for the coexistence and interaction of patterns with different symmetries. We show that local, pattern-induced symmetry breaking can account for dynamically coexisting patterns with different symmetries. Specifically, in a regime with moderate densities and a weak polar bias in the alignment interaction, nematic bands show a local symmetry-breaking instability within their high-density core region, which induces the formation of polar waves along the bands. These instabilities eventually result in a self-organized system of nematic bands and polar waves that dynamically transform into each other. Our study reveals a mutual feedback mechanism between pattern formation and local symmetry breaking in active matter that has interesting consequences for structure formation in biological systems.All relevant data are within this paper and SI Appendix.},

Simulations and experiments are used to demonstrate that topological defects can be generated at will and then constrained to move along specified trajectories by inducing local stresses in an otherwise passive material. These results provide a foundation for the design of autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems where transport is controlled by modulating activity with light.},

@article{sciortino2021pattern,
	abstract = {Pattern formation processes in active systems give rise to a plethora of collective structures. Predicting how the emergent structures depend on the microscopic interactions between the moving agents remains a challenge. By introducing a high-density actin gliding assay on a fluid membrane, we demonstrate the emergence of polar structures in a regime of nematic binary interactions dominated by steric repulsion. The transition from a microscopic nematic symmetry to a macroscopic polar structure is linked to microscopic polarity sorting mechanisms, including accumulation in wedge-like topological defects. Our results should be instrumental for a better understanding of pattern formation and polarity sorting processes in active matter.Collective motion of active matter is ubiquitously observed, ranging from propelled colloids to flocks of bird, and often features the formation of complex structures composed of agents moving coherently. However, it remains extremely challenging to predict emergent patterns from the binary interaction between agents, especially as only a limited number of interaction regimes have been experimentally observed so far. Here, we introduce an actin gliding assay coupled to a supported lipid bilayer, whose fluidity forces the interaction between self-propelled filaments to be dominated by steric repulsion. This results in filaments stopping upon binary collisions and eventually aligning nematically. Such a binary interaction rule results at high densities in the emergence of dynamic collectively moving structures including clusters, vortices, and streams of filaments. Despite the microscopic interaction having a nematic symmetry, the emergent structures are found to be polar, with filaments collectively moving in the same direction. This is due to polar biases introduced by the stopping upon collision, both on the individual filaments scale as well as on the scale of collective structures. In this context, positive half-charged topological defects turn out to be a most efficient trapping and polarity sorting conformation.The movies and scripts data have been deposited in Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3983553).},

	abstract = {Orientational topological defects in liquid crystals, known as disclinations, have been visualized in polymeric materials or through mesoscale simulations of the local orientation of the molecules. Duclos et al. report the experimental visualization of the structure and dynamics of disclination loops in active, three-dimensional nematics using light-sheet microscopy to watch the motion of nematic molecules driven by the motion of microtubule bundles (see the Perspective by Bartolo). This setup makes it possible to directly watch the nucleation, deformation, recombination, and collapse of spatially extended topological defects in three dimensions.Science, this issue p. 1120; see also p. 1075Topological structures are effective descriptors of the nonequilibrium dynamics of diverse many-body systems. For example, motile, point-like topological defects capture the salient features of two-dimensional active liquid crystals composed of energy-consuming anisotropic units. We dispersed force-generating microtubule bundles in a passive colloidal liquid crystal to form a three-dimensional active nematic. Light-sheet microscopy revealed the temporal evolution of the millimeter-scale structure of these active nematics with single-bundle resolution. The primary topological excitations are extended, charge-neutral disclination loops that undergo complex dynamics and recombination events. Our work suggests a framework for analyzing the nonequilibrium dynamics of bulk anisotropic systems as diverse as driven complex fluids, active metamaterials, biological tissues, and collections of robots or organisms.},

Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources. Consisting of individual members, aggregations nevertheless function as an integrated whole, displaying a complex set of behaviors not possible at the level of the individual organism. Complexity theory indicates that large populations of units can self-organize into aggregations that generate pattern, store information, and engage in collective decision-making. This begs the question, are all emergent properties of animal aggregations functional or are some simply pattern? Solutions to this dilemma will necessitate a closer marriage of theoretical and modeling studies linked to empirical work addressing the choices, and trajectories, of individuals constrained by membership in the group.},

@article{han2020emergence,
	abstract = {Active materials maintained out of equilibrium due to external energy consumption promise access to tunable structures capable of swarming, shape shifting, and self-healing{\textemdash}properties known mostly throughout the biological world. Developing fundamental understanding and controls of these synthetic systems remains challenging. Active colloidal dispersion of rollers energized by an alternating magnetic field reveals complex emergent dynamics of self-organized vortex structures. Reminiscent of the collective behavior observed in living systems, the emergent vortices are well localized in space and unbound from the geometrical constraints. Our findings provide fundamental insight into the emergence of macroscopic behavior in active roller dispersions and suggest strategies for self-assembled dynamic materials and particulate manipulation at the microscale.Active matter, both synthetic and biological, demonstrates complex spatiotemporal self-organization and the emergence of collective behavior. A coherent rotational motion, the vortex phase, is of great interest because of its ability to orchestrate well-organized motion of self-propelled particles over large distances. However, its generation without geometrical confinement has been a challenge. Here, we show by experiments and computational modeling that concentrated magnetic rollers self-organize into multivortex states in an unconfined environment. We find that the neighboring vortices more likely occur with the opposite sense of rotation. Our studies provide insights into the mechanism for the emergence of coherent collective motion on the macroscale from the coupling between microscale rotation and translation of individual active elements. These results may stimulate design strategies for self-assembled dynamic materials and microrobotics.},

	abstract = {Bacterial cytokinesis is commonly initiated by the Z-ring, a cytoskeletal structure that assembles at the site of division. Its primary component is FtsZ, a tubulin superfamily GTPase, which is recruited to the membrane by the actin-related protein FtsA. Both proteins are required for the formation of the Z-ring, but if and how they influence each other's assembly dynamics is not known. Here, we reconstituted FtsA-dependent recruitment of FtsZ polymers to supported membranes, where both proteins self-organize into complex patterns, such as fast-moving filament bundles and chirally rotating rings. Using fluorescence microscopy and biochemical perturbations, we found that these large-scale rearrangements of FtsZ emerge from its polymerization dynamics and a dual, antagonistic role of FtsA: recruitment of FtsZ filaments to the membrane and negative regulation of FtsZ organization. Our findings provide a model for the initial steps of bacterial cell division and illustrate how dynamic polymers can self-organize into large-scale structures.},

@article{suzuki2017spatial,
	abstract = {At the microscopic scale, collective behaviors of motile units can induce directed fluid flow on a larger length scale than individual units based on their hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we found that the motor-driven extensile behaviors of microtubule bundles in the cytoplasm induce rotational flow in a cell-sized confined space on length scale and timescale that were 10- to 100-fold longer than the vortex flows emerging in the bulk space. These scale differences were derived from mechanical force generation by microtubule bundle elongation near the physical boundary and the transmission of this force over the microtubule network. These findings suggest that the microtubule cytoskeleton utilizes not only hydrodynamic interactions but also mechanical interactions to induce large-scale cytoplasmic flow.Collective behaviors of motile units through hydrodynamic interactions induce directed fluid flow on a larger length scale than individual units. In cells, active cytoskeletal systems composed of polar filaments and molecular motors drive fluid flow, a process known as cytoplasmic streaming. The motor-driven elongation of microtubule bundles generates turbulent-like flow in purified systems; however, it remains unclear whether and how microtubule bundles induce large-scale directed flow like the cytoplasmic streaming observed in cells. Here, we adopted Xenopus egg extracts as a model system of the cytoplasm and found that microtubule bundle elongation induces directed flow for which the length scale and timescale depend on the existence of geometrical constraints. At the lower activity of dynein, kinesins bundle and slide microtubules, organizing extensile microtubule bundles. In bulk extracts, the extensile bundles connected with each other and formed a random network, and vortex flows with a length scale comparable to the bundle length continually emerged and persisted for 1 min at multiple places. When the extracts were encapsulated in droplets, the extensile bundles pushed the droplet boundary. This pushing force initiated symmetry breaking of the randomly oriented bundle network, leading to bundles aligning into a rotating vortex structure. This vortex induced rotational cytoplasmic flows on the length scale and timescale that were 10- to 100-fold longer than the vortex flows emerging in bulk extracts. Our results suggest that microtubule systems use not only hydrodynamic interactions but also mechanical interactions to induce large-scale temporally stable cytoplasmic flow.},

In these models, active interactions among agents are typically included such as velocity alignment and cohesive and repulsive forces that represent agents' short- and long-range `sensing' capabilities of their environment. Here, we show that similar collective behaviors can emerge in a minimal model of isotropic agents solely due to a passive mechanism---inelastic collisions among agents. The model dynamics shows a gradual velocity correlation build-up into the collective motion state. The model displays a discontinuous transition of collective motion with respect to noise and exhibits several collective motion types such as vortex formation, swarm migration and also complex spatio-temporal group motion. This model can be regarded as a hybrid model, connecting granular materials and agent-based models.},

Motivated by these findings{,} we analyze the two-dimensional dynamics in confined suspensions of active self-propelled swimmers using a mean-field kinetic theory where conservation equations for the particle configurations are coupled to the forced Navier--Stokes equations for the self-generated fluid flow. In circular domains{,} a systematic exploration of the parameter space casts light on three distinct states: equilibrium with no flow{,} stable vortex{,} and chaotic motion{,} and the transitions between these are explained and predicted quantitatively using a linearized theory. In periodic racetracks{,} similar transitions from equilibrium to net pumping to traveling waves to chaos are observed in agreement with experimental observations and are also explained theoretically. Our results underscore the subtle effects of geometry on the morphology and dynamics of emerging patterns in active suspensions and pave the way for the control of active collective motion in microfluidic devices.},

@article{lushi2014fluid,
	abstract = {The collective dynamics of swimming microorganisms exhibits a complex interplay with the surrounding fluid: the motile cells stir the fluid, which in turn can reorient and advect them. This feedback loop can result in long-range interactions between the cells, an effect whose significance remains controversial. We present a computational model that takes into account these cell{\textendash}fluid interactions and cell{\textendash}cell forces and that predicts counterintuitive cellular order driven by long-range flows. This prediction is confirmed with experimental studies that track the orientation of cells in a confined, dense bacterial suspension.Concentrated suspensions of swimming microorganisms and other forms of active matter are known to display complex, self-organized spatiotemporal patterns on scales that are large compared with those of the individual motile units. Despite intensive experimental and theoretical study, it has remained unclear the extent to which the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming cells, rather than purely steric interactions between them, drive the self-organization. Here we use the recent discovery of a spiral-vortex state in confined suspensions of Bacillus subtilis to study this issue in detail. Those experiments showed that if the radius of confinement in a thin cylindrical chamber is below a critical value, the suspension will spontaneously form a steady single-vortex state encircled by a counter-rotating cell boundary layer, with spiral cell orientation within the vortex. Left unclear, however, was the flagellar orientation, and hence the cell swimming direction, within the spiral vortex. Here, using a fast simulation method that captures oriented cell{\textendash}cell and cell{\textendash}fluid interactions in a minimal model of discrete particle systems, we predict the striking, counterintuitive result that in the presence of collectively generated fluid motion, the cells within the spiral vortex actually swim upstream against those flows. This prediction is then confirmed by the experiments reported here, which include measurements of flagella bundle orientation and cell tracking in the self-organized state. These results highlight the complex interplay between cell orientation and hydrodynamic flows in concentrated suspensions of microorganisms.},

Here, using the micropatterned epithelial monolayer as a model system, we report the discovery of a mechanical wave that propagates slowly to span the monolayer, traverses intercellular junctions in a cooperative manner and builds up differentials of mechanical stress. Essential features of this wave generation and propagation are captured by a minimal model based on sequential fronts of cytoskeletal reinforcement and fluidization. These findings establish a mechanism of long-range cell guidance, symmetry breaking and pattern formation during monolayer expansion.},

@article{Rubenstein2014programmable,
	abstract = {When individuals swarm, they must somehow communicate to direct collective motion. Swarms of robots need to deal with outliers, such as robots that move more slowly than the rest. Rubenstein et al. created a large swarm of programmed robots that can form collaborations using only local information. The robots could communicate only with nearby members, within about three times their diameter. They were able to assemble into complex preprogrammed shapes. If the robots{\textquoteright} formation hit snags when they bumped into one another or because of an outlier, additional algorithms guided them to rectify their collective movements.Science, this issue p. 795Self-assembly enables nature to build complex forms, from multicellular organisms to complex animal structures such as flocks of birds, through the interaction of vast numbers of limited and unreliable individuals. Creating this ability in engineered systems poses challenges in the design of both algorithms and physical systems that can operate at such scales. We report a system that demonstrates programmable self-assembly of complex two-dimensional shapes with a thousand-robot swarm. This was enabled by creating autonomous robots designed to operate in large groups and to cooperate through local interactions and by developing a collective algorithm for shape formation that is highly robust to the variability and error characteristic of large-scale decentralized systems. This work advances the aim of creating artificial swarms with the capabilities of natural ones.},

@article{alert2020physical,
	abstract = { Collective cell migration is a key driver of embryonic development, wound healing, and some types of cancer invasion. Here, we provide a physical perspective of the mechanisms underlying collective cell migration. We begin with a catalog of the cell--cell and cell--substrate interactions that govern cell migration, which we classify into positional and orientational interactions. We then review the physical models that have been developed to explain how these interactions give rise to collective cellular movement. These models span the subcellular to the supracellular scales, and they include lattice models, phase-field models, active network models, particle models, and continuum models. For each type of model, we discuss its formulation, its limitations, and the main emergent phenomena that it has successfully explained. These phenomena include flocking and fluid--solid transitions, as well as wetting, fingering, and mechanical waves in spreading epithelial monolayers. We close by outlining remaining challenges and future directions in the physics of collective cell migration. },

@article{weijer1999morphogenetic,
	abstract = {Dictyostelium morphogenesis starts with the chemotactic aggregation of starving individual cells. The cells move in response to propagating waves of the chemoattractant cyclic AMP initiated by cells in the aggregation centre. During aggregation the cells begin to differentiate into several types with different signalling and chemotactic properties. These cell types sort out from each other to form an axial pattern in the slug. There is now good evidence that periodic chemotactic signals not only control aggregation, but also later stages of morphogenesis. These signals take the form of target patterns, spirals, multi-armed spirals and scroll waves. I will discuss their role in the control of cell movement during mound and slug formation and in the formation of the fruiting body.},

@article{zhang2014experimental,
	abstract = {In the last few decades{,} the controlled colloidal assembly was adopted as a new modelling technology for the study of the crystallization mechanism. In colloidal systems{,} the movement of particles is slow enough to follow and the particle dynamics can be monitored at the single-particle level using normal optical microscopes. So far{,} the studies of colloidal crystallization have produced a number of insights{,} which have significantly improved our understanding of crystallization. In this review{,} we summarize the recent advances in understanding the mechanism of crystallization{,} which were achieved using colloidal model systems{,} i.e.{,} the kinetics of nucleation{,} growth and defect formation. Such model systems allow us to not only visualize some ``atomic'' details of nucleation and surface processes of crystallization{,} but also quantify previous models to such an extent that has never been achieved before by other approaches. In the case of nucleation{,} the quantitative observation of the kinetic process was made at the single-particle level; the results include the ideal case and the deviations from classical theories. The deviations include multi-step crystallization{,} supersaturation-driven structural mismatch nucleation{,} defect creation and migration kinetics{,} surface roughening{,} etc. It can be foreseen that this approach will become a powerful tool to study the fundamental process of crystallization and other phase transitions.},

@article{berche2004bond,
	abstract = {We study by Monte Carlo simulations the influence of bond dilution on the three-dimensional Ising model. This paradigmatic model in its pure version displays a second-order phase transition with a positive specific heat critical exponent {\$}{$\backslash$}alpha{\$}. According to the Harris criterion disorder should hence lead to a new fixed point characterized by new critical exponents. We have determined the phase diagram of the diluted model, starting from the pure model limit down to the neighbourhood of the percolation threshold. For the estimation of critical exponents, we have first performed a finite-size scaling study, where we concentrated on three different dilutions to check the stability of the disorder fixed point. We emphasize in this work the great influence of the cross-over phenomena between the pure, disorder and percolation fixed points which lead to effective critical exponents dependent on the concentration. In a second set of simulations, the temperature behaviour of physical quantities has been studied in order to characterize the disorder fixed point more accurately. In particular this allowed us to estimate ratios of some critical amplitudes. In accord with previous observations for other models this provides stronger evidence for the existence of the disorder fixed point since the amplitude ratios are more sensitive to the universality class than the critical exponents. Moreover, the question of non-self-averaging at the disorder fixed point is investigated and compared with recent results for the bond-diluted q = 4 Potts model. Overall our numerical results provide evidence that, as expected on theoretical grounds, the critical behaviour of the bond-diluted model is indeed governed by the same universality class as the site-diluted model.},

@article{harris1974effect,
	abstract = {A cumulant expansion is used to calculate the transition temperature of Ising models with random-bond defects. For a concentration, x, of missing interactions in the simple-square Ising model the author finds -Tc-1 dTc/dx mod x=0=1.329 compared with the mean-field value of one. If the interactions are independent random variable with a width delta J/J identical to epsilon , the result is -Tc-1 dTc/d epsilon 2 mod epsilon =0=0.312 compared with the mean-field results of zero. An approximation yields the specific heat in the critical regime as C approximately C0/(1+x gamma 2C0), where gamma is a constant and C0 is the unperturbed specific heat at a renormalized temperature. Thus, the specific heat divergence is broadened over a temperature interval Delta T, with Delta T/Tc approximately x(1 alpha )/, where alpha is the critical exponent for the specific heat, and a maximum value of order x-1 is attained. Heuristic arguments show that this smoothing effect occurs if alpha >0.},

@article{edwards1975theory,
	abstract = {A new theory of the class of dilute magnetic alloys, called the spin glasses, is proposed which offers a simple explanation of the cusp found experimentally in the susceptibility. The argument is that because the interaction between the spins dissolved in the matrix oscillates in sign according to distance, there will be no mean ferro- or antiferromagnetism, but there will be a ground state with the spins aligned in definite directions, even if these directions appear to be at random. At the critical temperature the existence of these preferred directions affects the orientation of the spins, leading to a cusp in the susceptibility. This cusp is smoothed by an external field. Although the behaviour at low t needs a quantum mechanical treatment, it is interesting to complete the classical calculations down to t=0. Classically the susceptibility tends to a constant value at t=0, and the specific heat to a constant value.},

@article{pince2016disorder-mediated,
	abstract = {Living active matter systems such as bacterial colonies, schools of fish and human crowds, display a wealth of emerging collective and dynamic behaviours as a result of far-from-equilibrium interactions. The dynamics of these systems are better understood and controlled considering their interaction with the environment, which for realistic systems is often highly heterogeneous and disordered. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of spatial disorder can alter the long-term dynamics in a colloidal active matter system, making it switch between gathering and dispersal of individuals. At equilibrium, colloidal particles always gather at the bottom of any attractive potential; however, under non-equilibrium driving forces in a bacterial bath, the colloids disperse if disorder is added to the potential. The depth of the local roughness in the environment regulates the transition between gathering and dispersal of individuals in the active matter system, thus inspiring novel routes for controlling emerging behaviours far from equilibrium.},

@article{chate2020dry,
	abstract = { Active matter physics is about systems in which energy is dissipated at some local level to produce work. This is a generic situation, particularly in the living world but not only. What is at stake is the understanding of the fascinating, sometimes counterintuitive, emerging phenomena observed, from collective motion in animal groups to in vitro dynamical self-organization of motor proteins and biofilaments. Dry aligning dilute active matter (DADAM) is a corner of the multidimensional, fast-growing domain of active matter that has both historical and theoretical importance for the entire field. This restrictive setting only involves self-propulsion/activity, alignment, and noise, yet unexpected collective properties can emerge from it. This review provides a personal but synthetic and coherent overview of DADAM, focusing on the collective-level phenomenology of simple active particle models representing basic classes of systems and on the solutions of the continuous hydrodynamic theories that can be derived from them. The obvious fact that orientational order is advected by the aligning active particles at play is shown to be at the root of the most striking properties of DADAM systems: (a) direct transitions to orientational order are not observed; (b) instead generic phase separation occurs with a coexistence phase involving inhomogeneous nonlinear structures; (c) orientational order, which can be long range even in two dimensions, is accompanied by long-range correlations and anomalous fluctuations; (d) defects are not point-like, topologically bound objects. },

@article{martinez2018collective,
	abstract = {In our work we have studied a two-dimensional suspension of finite-size Vicsek hard disks, whose time evolution follows an event-driven dynamics between subsequent time steps. Having compared its collective behaviour with the one expected for a system of scalar Vicsek point-like particles, we have analysed the effect of considering two possible bouncing rules between the disks: a Vicsek-like rule and a pseudo-elastic one, focusing on the order-disorder transition. Next, we have added to the two-dimensional suspension of hard-disk Vicsek particles disk-like passive obstacles of two types: either fixed in space or moving according to the same event-driven dynamics. We have performed a detailed analysis of the particles' collective behaviour observed for both fixed and moving obstacles. In the fixed obstacles case, we have observed formation of clusters at low noise, in agreement with previous studies. When using moving passive obstacles, we found that that order of active particles is better destroyed as the drag of obstacles increases. In the no drag limit an interesting result was found: introduction of low drag passive particles can lead in some cases to a more ordered state of active flocking particles than what they show in bulk.},

@article{Kaiser:2003xy,
	abstract = {Myxobacteria are Gram-negatives commonly found in the top soil that exhibit social, multicellular behaviour.In the presence of nutrients, myxobacteria feed by forming cooperative swarms of cells, and can prey on other bacteria. In the absence of nutrients, at high cell density on a solid surface they undergo a complex developmental programme, which culminates in the formation of a multicellular fruiting body.Myxobacteria move by gliding motility, which is controlled by two different gliding engines: the S-engine and the A-engine. The S-engine acts as the 'puller' and comprises pili that pull the cells forward by retraction. The A-engine acts as the 'pusher' and pushes cells forward by secreting ribbons of polysaccharide-rich slime.The multicellular development programme of myxobacteria is controlled by a cell-contact-dependent signal, the C-signal.The following development scheme for fruiting-body formation is proposed. The first form of organized movement in a myxobacterial culture is the formation of a wave pattern. The collision of travelling waves of cells in an area of high-cell density creates stationary aggregates of cells, which can become motile and fuse with adjacent aggregates by an as-yet-unknown mechanism. Within the motile aggregates, the myxobacterial cells are streaming in cycles. Travelling waves of cells continue to wash over the aggregates, which accumulate in size to form fruiting bodies comprising up to 105 individual cells. Cell-to-cell contact by motile cells within the aggregates transmits the C-signal between cells, and through a positive-feedback mechanism, the level of C-signal reaches the threshold required for sporulation.The 40 different species of myxobacteria can form fruiting bodies in a variety of shapes and sizes, with both depending on multicellular communication through a cell-contact-dependent system. Understanding this fascinating process could have implications for eukaryotic developmental biology.},

@article{Igoshin4256,
	abstract = {Under starvation conditions, a population of myxobacteria aggregates to build a fruiting body whose shape is species-specific and within which the cells sporulate. Early in this process, cells often pass through a {\textquotedblleft}ripple phase{\textquotedblright} characterized by traveling linear, concentric, and spiral waves. These waves are different from the waves observed during slime mold aggregation that depend on diffusible morphogens, because myxobacteria communicate by direct contact. The difference is most dramatic when waves collide: rather than annihilating one another, myxobacterial waves appear to pass through one another unchanged. Under certain conditions, the spacing and location of the nascent fruiting bodies is determined by the wavelength and pattern of the waves. Later in fruiting body development, waves are replaced by streams of cells that circulate around small initial aggregates enlarging and rounding them. Still later, pairs of motile aggregates coalesce to form larger aggregates that develop into fruiting bodies. Here we present a mathematical model that quantitatively explains these wave and aggregation phenomena.},

   because group members constantly share directional information with
   their neighbors. Although detecting the directionality of other group
   members is known to be important to maintain cohesion, it is not clear
   how many neighbors each individual can simultaneously track and pay
   attention to, and what the spatial distribution of these influential
   neighbors is. Here, we address these questions on shoals of Hemigrammus
   rhodostomus, a species of fish exhibiting strong schooling behavior. We
   adopt a data-driven analysis technique based on the study of short-term
   directional correlations to identify which neighbors have the strongest
   influence over the participation of an individual in a collective U-turn
   event. We find that fish mainly react to one or two neighbors at a time.
   Moreover, we find no correlation between the distance rank of a neighbor
   and its likelihood to be influential. We interpret our results in terms
   of fish allocating sequential and selective attention to their
   neighbors.}},

	abstract = {{Collective motion phenomena in large groups of social organisms have
   long fascinated the observer, especially in cases, such as bird flocks
   or fish schools, where large-scale highly coordinated actions emerge in
   the absence of obvious leaders. However, the mechanisms involved in this
   self-organized behavior are still poorly understood, because the
   individual-level interactions underlying them remain elusive. Here, we
   demonstrate the power of a bottom-up methodology to build models for
   animal group motion from data gathered at the individual scale. Using
   video tracks of fish shoal in a tank, we show how a careful, incremental
   analysis at the local scale allows for the determination of the
   stimulus/response function governing an individual's moving decisions.
   We find in particular that both positional and orientational effects are
   present, act upon the fish turning speed, and depend on the swimming
   speed, yielding a novel schooling model whose parameters are all
   estimated from data. Our approach also leads to identify a
   density-dependent effect that results in a behavioral change for the
   largest groups considered. This suggests that, in confined environment,
   the behavioral state of fish and their reaction patterns change with
   group size. We debate the applicability, beyond the particular case
   studied here, of this novel framework for deciphering interactions in
   moving animal groups.}},

@article{moussaid2011how,
	abstract = {{With the increasing size and frequency of mass events, the study of
   crowd disasters and the simulation of pedestrian flows have become
   important research areas. However, even successful modeling approaches
   such as those inspired by Newtonian force models are still not fully
   consistent with empirical observations and are sometimes hard to
   calibrate. Here, a cognitive science approach is proposed, which is
   based on behavioral heuristics. We suggest that, guided by visual
   information, namely the distance of obstructions in candidate lines of
   sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures to adapt their
   walking speeds and directions. Although simpler than previous
   approaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective
   patterns of motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety
   of empirical and experimental data. This model predicts the emergence of
   self-organization phenomena, such as the spontaneous formation of
   unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves. Moreover, the combination of
   pedestrian heuristics with body collisions generates crowd turbulence at
   extreme densities-a phenomenon that has been observed during recent
   crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of simultaneous
   interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes
   limitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models.
   Understanding crowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore
   not only crucial for a better preparation of safe mass events. It also
   clears the way for a more realistic modeling of collective social
   behaviors, in particular of human crowds and biological swarms.
   Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve to improve the
   navigation of autonomous robots.}},

In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active systems. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active system. These results provide a pathway by which living systems can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.},

Although the network components and their properties are known, and networks can be reconstituted in vitro, the requirements for contractility are still poorly understood. Here, we describe a theory that predicts whether an isotropic network will contract, expand, or conserve its dimensions. This analytical theory correctly predicts the behavior of simulated networks, consisting of filaments with varying combinations of connectors, and reveals conditions under which networks of rigid filaments are either contractile or expansile. Our results suggest that pulsatility is an intrinsic behavior of contractile networks if the filaments are not stable but turn over. The theory offers a unifying framework to think about mechanisms of contractions or expansion. It provides the foundation for studying a broad range of processes involving cytoskeletal networks and a basis for designing synthetic networks.},

We demonstrate that the model qualitatively and quantitatively captures a suite of trends observed experimentally, including the statistics of filament fluctuations, and mechanical responses to shear, motor motilities, and network rearrangements. We use the simulation to predict the viscoelastic scaling behavior of cross-linked actin networks, characterize the trajectories of actin in a myosin motility assay, and develop order parameters to measure contractility of a simulated actin network. The model can thus serve as a platform for interpretation and design of cytoskeletal materials experiments, as well as for further development of simulations incorporating active elements.},

	abstract = {Contractile forces are essential for many developmental processes involving cell shape change and tissue deformation. Recent experiments on reconstituted actomyosin networks, the major component of the contractile machinery, have shown that active contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration and within a window of cross-link concentration. We present a microscopic dynamic model that incorporates two essential aspects of actomyosin self-organization: the asymmetric load response of individual actin filaments and the correlated motor-driven events mimicking myosin-induced filament sliding. Using computer simulations, we examine how the concentration and susceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay with the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model is shown to capture the formation and dynamics of contractile structures and agree with the observed dependence of active contractility on microscopic parameters, including the contractility onset. Cooperative action of load-resisting motors in a force-percolating structure integrates local contraction/buckling events into a global contractile state via an active coarsening process, in contrast to the flow transition driven by uncorrelated kicks of susceptible motors.},

We find that motor activity controls the elasticity in an anomalous fashion close to the point of marginal stability by coupling to critical network fluctuations. We also show that motor stresses can stabilize initially floppy networks, extending the range of critical behavior to a broad regime of network connectivities below the marginal point. Away from this regime, or at high stress, motors give rise to a linear increase in stiffness with stress. Finally, we demonstrate that our results are captured by a simple, constitutive scaling relation highlighting the important role of non-affine strain fluctuations as a susceptibility to motor stress.},

Although synchronizing entities often self-propel, like fireflies, people, etc., the present understanding of synchronization applies mostly to immobile phase oscillators. Here, we show that self-propulsion qualitatively affects the synchronization of oscillators in a way that it is impossible in passive systems. This activity-induced macroscopic synchronization generates two novel phases: one where oscillators of opposite chirality, rotating clock-wise or anti-clockwise, mutually suppress their rotations and cooperate to move collectively along a given direction, akin to the celebrated homogeneous flocking phase in active matter; and a second phase where oscillators segregate accordingly to their chirality and form synchronized macroscopic clusters. In both phases, self-propulsion supports synchronization via a positive feedback loop involving motility, a mechanism which is absent in traditional (static or dynamic) networks of oscillators and induces macroscopic synchronization in a 2D system with purely local interactions.},

Here, we interpret active (or self-propelled) chiral microswimmers with a distribution of intrinsic frequencies as motile oscillators and show that they can synchronize over very large distances, even for local coupling in 2D. This opposes to canonical non-active oscillators on static or time-dependent networks, leading to synchronized domains only. A consequence of this activity-induced synchronization is the emergence of a `mutual flocking phase', where particles of opposite chirality cooperate to form superimposed flocks moving at a relative angle to each other, providing a chiral active matter analogue to the celebrated Toner-Tu phase. The underlying mechanism employs a positive feedback loop involving the two-way coupling between oscillators' phase and self-propulsion, and could be exploited as a design principle for synthetic active materials and chiral self-sorting techniques},

	abstract = {Actomyosin contractility plays a central role in a wide range of cellular processes, including the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, tissue integrity, and morphogenesis during development. The contractile response is variable and depends on actomyosin network architecture and biochemical composition. To determine how this coupling regulates actomyosin-driven contraction, we used a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin assembly. We generated a variety of actin templates and measured how defined actin structures respond to myosin-induced forces. We found that the same actin filament crosslinkers either enhance or inhibit the contractility of a network, depending on the organization of actin within the network. Numerical simulations unified the roles of actin filament branching and crosslinking during actomyosin contraction. Specifically, we introduce the concept of "network connectivity" and show that the contractions of distinct actin architectures are described by the same master curve when considering their degree of connectivity. This makes it possible to predict the dynamic response of defined actin structures to transient changes in connectivity. We propose that, depending on the connectivity and the architecture, network contraction is dominated by either sarcomeric-like or buckling mechanisms. More generally, this study reveals how actin network contractility depends on its architecture under a defined set of biochemical conditions.},

Here we tagged the lysosomes in live cells with fluorescent probe and imaged their spatial motion with wide field microscopy. To quantitatively characterize the collective lysosomal behavior with high spatiotemporal heterogeneity dynamics, we developed the particle collective analysis (PECAN) method based on the single particle tracking techniques. Thousands of trajectories were detected and analyzed in each single cell. The reliability was validated by comparing with traditional PIV method, simulated and experimental data sets. We show that the lysosomes in live cells move collectively with spatial heterogeneous and temporal long-term correlated dynamics. Furthermore, the continuous wavelet analysis suggested the existence of collective lysosomal oscillation in mouse neural cells. Generally, our method provides a practical workflow for characterizing the collective lysosomal motions which can benefit related areas such as organelles mediated drug delivery and cell activity profiling.},

The particles, which are of finite size and are in free flight between collisions, are not self-propelled. They tumble randomly like bacteria and interact only when they collide, not through continuous potential forces. This work therefore indicates that interactions at the microscopic level, which occur only locally and discretely both in time and space, are sufficient to lead to large-scale macroscopic behaviors. Order parameters that capture and quantify the formation of collective behaviors are introduced and used to describe how the choice of collision rule affects the steady state dynamics of the system, by comparing the outcome to the standard case of elastic collisions.

	abstract = {Flocking birds, fish schools, and insect swarms are familiar examples of collective motion that plays a role in a range of problems, such as spreading of diseases. Models have provided a qualitative understanding of the collective motion, but progress has been hindered by the lack of detailed experimental data. Here we report simultaneous measurements of the positions, velocities, and orientations as a function of time for up to a thousand wild-type Bacillus subtilis bacteria in a colony. The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move cooperatively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium. Such "giant number fluctuations" have been found in models and in experiments on inert systems but not observed previously in a biological system. Our results demonstrate that bacteria are an excellent system to study the general phenomenon of collective motion.},

We show that active particles in a noisy environment can self organize into three typical phases: polar liquid, band, and disordered gas states. In our model, the transition between band and disordered gas states is discontinuous. Giant number fluctuation is observed in the polar liquid phase. We also compare our results with the Vicsek model and show that the interaction with noise particles can stabilize the band state to very low noise condition. This band structure could recruit most of the active particles in the system, which greatly enhances the coherence of the system. Our findings of complex collective behaviors in environmental noise help us to understand how individuals modify their self-organization by environmental factors, which may further contribute to improving the design of collective migration and navigation strategies.},

In particular, microorganism systems have served as model systems for observing dynamic assembly and collective motility of active particles and significant progresses have been made on in-depth understanding of how high density bacteria colony behaves in the non-equilibrium state. In this mini-review, we mainly focus on the collective motion of bacteria and their dynamic assembly from four aspects: (1) the general phenomenon and biological mechanism of bacterial collective motion; (2) the common experimental techniques for studying bacterial motility; (3) some active systems on exploring bacterial collective behavior, which include both non-restricted free suspensions and those in relative confined geometric space; (4) the phenomenological and descriptive statistical methods and physical models on the underlying laws that lead to large-scale coordinate patterns in multicellular systems. This review aims to give a general picture of the collective motion in bacterial active matter systems experimentally and theoretically in order to reflect the interplays between individuals among populations in motion. It is expected that the general regulation rules related to the boundary effects in the complex systems and materials can be elucidated to some extent.},

@article{Kim2009,
	abstract = {Mechanical force plays an important role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells whose dominant structural constituent is the actin cytoskeleton composed mainly of actin and actin crosslinking proteins (ACPs). Thus, knowledge of rheological properties of actin networks is crucial for understanding the mechanics and processes of cells. We used Brownian dynamics simulations to study the viscoelasticity of crosslinked actin networks. Two methods were employed, bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology, where the former measures the stress in response to an applied shear strain, and the latter analyzes thermal fluctuations of individual actin segments of the network. It was demonstrated that the storage shear modulus (G') increases more by the addition of ACPs that form orthogonal crosslinks than by those that form parallel bundles. In networks with orthogonal crosslinks, as crosslink density increases, the power law exponent of G' as a function of the oscillation frequency decreases from 0.75, which reflects the transverse thermal motion of actin filaments, to near zero at low frequency. Under increasing prestrain, the network becomes more elastic, and three regimes of behavior are observed, each dominated by different mechanisms: bending of actin filaments, bending of ACPs, and at the highest prestrain tested (55{\%}), stretching of actin filaments and ACPs. In the last case, only a small portion of actin filaments connected via highly stressed ACPs support the strain. We thus introduce the concept of a 'supportive framework,' as a subset of the full network, which is responsible for high elasticity. Notably, entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations appear to be important only at relatively low prestrains and when the average crosslinking distance is comparable to or greater than the persistence length of the filament. Taken together, our results suggest that viscoelasticity of the actin network is attributable to different mechanisms depending on the amount of prestrain.},

For box sizes smaller than a certain large value, flocking appears continuously from a uniform disordered state at a critical value of the noise. Because of mass conservation, the amplitude equations describing the flocking state consist of a scalar equation for the density disturbance from the homogeneous particle density (particle number divided by box area) and a vector equation for a current density. These two equations contain two time scales. At the shorter scale, they are a hyperbolic system in which time and space scale in the same way. At the longer, diffusive, time scale, the equations are parabolic. The bifurcating solution depends on the angle and is uniform in space as in the normal form of the usual pitchfork bifurcation. We show that linearization about the latter solution is described by a Klein-Gordon equation in the hyperbolic time scale. Then there are persistent oscillations with many incommensurate frequencies about the bifurcating solution, they produce a shift in the critical noise and resonate with a periodic forcing of the alignment rule. These predictions are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the Vicsek model.},

	abstractnote = {In this letter we have introduced a minimal model for active nematic and found three distinct phases with the variation in density. At low densities the active nematic is in disordered isotropic state with very small correlation between the particles. With increasing density active nematic undergoes a fluctuation induced first order phase transition from the isotropic to the banded state where large number of particles participate in band formation. Large density fluctuations in the active systems change the nature of the transition and shift the transition density to smaller value as compared to the equilibrium isotropic nematic transition. At large densities equilibrium nematic is in QLRO nematic state, whereas active nematic goes from the banded state to either the homogeneous ordered (high S) or the inhomogeneous mixed (moderate S) state. This inhomogeneous mixed state is similar to the phase with coexisting aligned and disordered fibril domains found in recent experiment [26]. Experiments on thin layer of agitated granular rods, elongated living cells, bacterial colony of apolar B. subtilis etc. at different densities can realize the different phases we found here. In the present model we have frozen the motion of the active particles in the transverse direction, i.e. the activity strength is kept large. It will be interesting to see the evolution of different phases with the particles having a small probability to move in transverse directions as well.},

@article{Kim2015,
	abstract = {Actomyosin machinery is a fundamental engine consisting mostly of actin filaments, molecular motors, and passive cross-linkers, generating mechanical forces required for biological processes of non-muscle cells such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and morphogenesis. Although the molecular and physical properties of key elements in the actomyosin machinery have been characterized well, it still remains unclear how macroscopic force buildup and dissipation in actomyosin networks and bundles depend on the microscopic properties of individual cytoskeletal components and their local interactions. To bridge such a gap between macroscopic and microscopic scales, we have developed a three-dimensional computational model of actomyosin bundles clamped to an elastic substrate with minimal components: actin filaments, passive cross-linkers, and active motors. Our model accounts for several key features neglected by previous studies despite their significance for force generation, such as realistic structure and kinetics of the motors. Using the model, we systematically investigated how net tension in actomyosin bundles is governed via interplay between motors and cross-linkers. We demonstrated motors can generate large tension on a bundle in the absence of cross-linkers in a very inefficient, unstable manner. Cross-linkers help motors to generate their maximum potential forces as well as enhance overall connectivity, leading to much higher efficiency and stability. We showed further that the cross-linkers behave as a molecular clutch with tunable friction which has quite distinct effects on net tension depending on their cross-linking angles. We also examined the source of symmetry breaking between tensile and compressive forces during tension generation process and discussed how the length and dynamics of actin filaments and the stiffness of the elastic substrate can affect the generated tension.},

@article{Uriu_Morelli_2017,
	abstractnote = {Cell movement and intercellular signaling occur simultaneously to organize morphogenesis during embryonic development. Cell movement can cause relative positional changes between neighboring cells. When intercellular signals are local such cell mixing may affect signaling, changing the flow of information in developing tissues. Little is known about the effect of cell mixing on intercellular signaling in collective cellular behaviors and methods to quantify its impact are lacking. Here we discuss how to determine the impact of cell mixing on cell signaling drawing an example from vertebrate embryogenesis: the segmentation clock, a collective rhythm of interacting genetic oscillators. We argue that comparing cell mixing and signaling timescales is key to determining the influence of mixing. A signaling timescale can be estimated by combining theoretical models with cell signaling perturbation experiments. A mixing timescale can be obtained by analysis of cell trajectories from live imaging. After comparing cell movement analyses in different experimental settings, we highlight challenges in quantifying cell mixing from embryonic timelapse experiments, especially a reference frame problem due to embryonic motions and shape changes. We propose statistical observables characterizing cell mixing that do not depend on the choice of reference frames. Finally, we consider situations in which both cell mixing and signaling involve multiple timescales, precluding a direct comparison between single characteristic timescales. In such situations, physical models based on observables of cell mixing and signaling can simulate the flow of information in tissues and reveal the impact of observed cell mixing on signaling.},

@article{Head2003,
	abstract = {Semiflexible polymers such as filamentous actin (F-actin) play a vital role in the mechanical behavior of cells, yet the basic properties of cross-linked F-actin networks remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we have performed numerical studies of the linear response of homogeneous and isotropic two-dimensional networks subject to an applied strain at zero temperature. The elastic moduli are found to vanish for network densities at a rigidity percolation threshold. For higher densities, two regimes are observed: one in which the deformation is predominately affine and the filaments stretch and compress; and a second in which bending modes dominate. We identify a dimensionless scalar quantity, being a combination of the material length scales, that specifies to which regime a given network belongs. A scaling argument is presented that approximately agrees with this crossover variable. By a direct geometric measure, we also confirm that the degree of affinity under strain correlates with the distinct elastic regimes. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest possible directions for future investigations.},

The theory is formally justifiable in d = 1+ e dimensions and may be regarded as the natural continuation of the kink-based theory of one dimension, which it incorporates as a limiting case. In d = 1+ e the configurational building block is the droplet. The typical droplet is not spherical and the many-droplet assembly is not dilute: the implied problems are handled with renormalisation group methods. It is found that droplet shape fluctuation effects control the correlation length exponent v, while the nesting of droplets within droplets controls the order parameter exponent p. The exponents w and p thus effectively define, respectively, the fractal dimensions of the droplet surface and the droplet volume. The theory is used to determine and illuminate the critical behaviour of further quantities including the free energy, the susceptibility, the droplet number distribution and the distribution of the intra-droplet order.},

At low driving forces, we find a clogged phase with an isotropic density distribution, while at intermediate driving forces the disks separate into bands of high and low density with either liquid like or polycrystalline structure in the high density bands. In addition to the density phase separation, we find that in some cases there is a fractionation of the disk species, particularly when the disk size ratio is large. The species phase separated regimes form a variety of patterns such as large disks separated by chains of smaller disks. Our results show that the formation of laning states can be enhanced by tuning the ratio of disk radius of the two species, due to the clumping of small disks in the interstitial regions between the large disks.},

	abstract = {Dense suspensions of self-propelled rod-like particles exhibit a fascinating variety of non-equilibrium phenomena. By means of computer simulations of a minimal model for rigid self-propelled colloidal rods with variable shape we explore the generic diagram of emerging states over a large range of rod densities and aspect ratios. The dynamics is studied using a simple numerical scheme for the overdamped noiseless frictional dynamics of a many-body system in which steric forces are dominant over hydrodynamic ones. The different emergent states are identified by various characteristic correlation functions and suitable order parameter fields. At low density and aspect ratio, a disordered phase with no coherent motion precedes a highly cooperative swarming state with giant number fluctuations at large aspect ratio. Conversely, at high densities weakly anisometric particles show a distinct jamming transition whereas slender particles form dynamic laning patterns. In between there is a large window corresponding to strongly vortical, turbulent flow. The different dynamical states should be verifiable in systems of swimming bacteria and artificial rod-like micro-swimmers.},

However, state-of-the-art microscopy techniques and continuum modelling approaches focus on large length and time scales. Here, we perform component-based computer simulations of polar filaments and molecular motors linking microscopic interactions and activity to self-organisation and dynamics from the two-filament level up to the mesoscopic domain level. Dynamic filament crosslinking and sliding, and excluded-volume interactions promote formation of bundles at small densities, and of active polar nematics at high densities. A buckling-type instability sets the size of polar domains and the density of topological defects. We predict a universal scaling of the active diffusion coefficient and the domain size with activity, and its dependence on parameters like motor concentration and filament persistence length. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of cytoplasmic streaming in cells and help to develop design strategies for novel engineered active materials.},

	abstractnote = {Active matter consists of self-propelled elements exhibits fascinating collective motions ranging from biological to artificial systems. Among wide varieties of active matter systems, reconstituted bio-filaments moving on molecular motor turf interacting purely by physical interactions provides the fundamental test ground for understanding biological motility. However, for the emergence of ordered patterns such as polar pattern, swirls, clusters, and density wave in actomyosin motility assay, multi-filament collisions are required instead of binary collision which is often assumed in kinetic theory. Similarly, for microtubules driven by kinesin motors to produce nematic ordered state, depletion agents or binding molecules are required to introduce strong alignment effects between filaments. Thus, whether simple physical interactions during collisions such as steric effect without depletion nor binding agents are sufficient or not for producing ordered patterns in motility assays remains still elusive. In this article, we constructed a motility assay purely consists of kinesin motor and microtubule in which the frequency of binary collision can be controlled without using depletion nor binding agents. By controlling strength of steric interaction and density of microtubules, we found different states; disordered state, long-range orientationally ordered state, liquid-gas-like phase separated state, and transitions between them. We found that a balance between cross over and aligning events in collisions controls transition from disorder to global ordered state, while excessively strong steric effect leads to the phase separated clusters. Furthermore, macroscopic chiral symmetry breaking observed as a global rotation of nematic order observed in this experiment could be attributed to the chirality at molecular level. Numerical simulations in which we change strength of volume exclusion reproduce these experimental results. Moreover, it reveals the transition from long-range alignment to nematic bands then to aggregations. This study may provide new insights into dynamic ordering by self-propelled elements through a purely physical interaction.},

Here, we present a combined experimental-computational study that probes the dynamic evolution of mixtures of actin filaments and clusters of myosin motors. While on small spatial and temporal scales the system behaves in a very noisy manner, on larger scales it evolves into several well distinct patterns such as bundles, asters and networks. These patterns are characterized by junctions with high connectivity, whose formation is possible due to the organization of the motors in 'oligoclusters' (intermediate-size aggregates). The simulations reveal that the self-organization process proceeds through a series of hierarchical steps, starting from local microscopic moves and ranging up to the macroscopic large scales where the steady-state structures are formed. Our results shed light on the mechanisms involved in processes such as cytokinesis and cellular contractility, where myosin motors organized in clusters operate cooperatively to induce the structural organization of cytoskeletal networks.},

We find that, as with annealed disorder (Langevin noise), active polar systems are far more robust against quenched disorder than their equilibrium counterparts. In particular, long ranged order (i.e., the existence of a non-zero average velocity $langle {bf v} rangle$) persists in the presence of quenched disorder even in spatial dimensions $d=3$, while it is destroyed even by arbitrarily weak disorder in $d le 4$ in equilibrium systems. Furthermore, in $d=2$, quasi-long-ranged order (i.e., spatial velocity correlations that decay as a power law with distance) occurs when quenched disorder is present, in contrast to the short-ranged order that is all that can survive in equilibrium. These predictions are borne out by simulations in both two and three dimensions.},

While the core components are recognized, much less is understood about the behaviour of the integrated, disordered and internally active system with interdependent mechano-chemical component properties. Here we use a Brownian dynamics model that incorporates key and realistic features-specifically actin turnover, ACP (un)binding and motor walking-to reveal the nature and underlying regulatory mechanisms of overarching cytoskeletal states. We generate multi-dimensional maps that show the ratio in activity of these microscopic elements determines diverse global stress profiles and the induction of nonequilibrium morphological phase transition from homogeneous to aggregated networks. In particular, actin turnover dynamics plays a prominent role in tuning stress levels and stabilizing homogeneous morphologies in crosslinked, motor-driven networks. The consequence is versatile functionality, from dynamic steady-state prestress to large, pulsed constrictions.},

We argue that this occurs because any ordering fluctuation is enhanced by the flow field it produces. A phase diagram in the temperature-activity plane compares ordering due to a thermodynamic free energy to that resulting from the activity. We also demonstrate that activity can drive variations in concentration, but for a different physical reason that relies on the separation of hydrodynamic and diffusive time scales.},

@article{Stam2015,
	abstract = {Myosin II isoforms with varying mechanochemistry and filament size interact with filamentous actin (F-actin) arrays to generate contractile forces in muscle and nonmuscle cells. How myosin II force production is shaped by isoform-specific motor properties and environmental stiffness remains poorly understood. Here, we used computer simulations to analyze force production by an ensemble of myosin motors against an elastically tethered actin filament. We found that force output depends on two timescales: the duration of F-actin attachment, which varies sharply with the ensemble size, motor duty ratio, and external load; and the time to build force, which scales with the ensemble stall force, gliding speed, and environmental stiffness. Although force-dependent kinetics were not required to sense changes in stiffness, the myosin catch bond produced positive feedback between the attachment time and force to trigger switch-like transitions from transient attachments, generating small forces, to high-force-generating runs. Using parameters representative of skeletal muscle myosin, nonmuscle myosin IIB, and nonmuscle myosin IIA revealed three distinct regimes of behavior, respectively: 1) large assemblies of fast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of environmental stiffness; 2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as high-affinity cross-links with force buildup times that exceed physiological timescales; and 3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at intermediate speeds are poised to respond sharply to changes in mechanical context - at low force or stiffness, they serve as low-affinity cross-links, but they can transition to force production via the positive-feedback mechanism described above. Together, these results reveal how myosin isoform properties may be tuned to produce force and respond to mechanical cues in their environment.},

Traditionally, in thermal equilibrium, one assumes (i) the forces are given as the gradient of a potential and (ii) a fluctuation-dissipation relation holds between stochastic and dissipative forces; these assumptions ensure that the system samples a prescribed invariant Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for a specified target temperature. In this article, we relax these assumptions, incorporating variable friction and temperature parameters and allowing nonconservative force fields, for which the form of the stationary state is typically not known a priori. We examine theoretical issues such as stability of the steady state and ergodic properties, as well as practical aspects such as the design of numerical methods for stochastic particle models. Applications to nonequilibrium systems with thermal gradients and active particles are discussed.},

In response to light, some colloidal particles (CPs), including light active and passive CPs, can mimic their counterparts in nature and organize into complex structures that exhibit collective functions with remote controllability and high temporospatial precision. In this review, we firstly analyze the structural characteristics of swarms and assemblies of CPs and point out that light-controlled swarming and assembly of CPs are generally achieved by constructing light-responsive interactions between CPs. Then, we summarize in detail the recent advances in light-controlled swarming and assembly of CPs based on the interactions arisen from optical forces, photochemical reactions, photothermal effects, and photoisomerizations, as well as their potential applications. In the end, we also envision some challenges and future prospects of light-controlled swarming and assembly of CPs. With the increasing innovations in mechanisms and control strategies with easy operation, low cost, and arbitrary applicability, light-controlled swarming and assembly of CPs may be employed to manufacture programmable materials and reconfigurable robots for cooperative grasping, collective cargo transportation, and micro- and nanoengineering.},

Here, we demonstrate a form of self-organization from nonequilibrium driving forces in a suspension of synthetic photoactivated colloidal particles. They lead to two-dimensional "living crystals," which form, break, explode, and re-form elsewhere. The dynamic assembly results from a competition between self-propulsion of particles and an attractive interaction induced respectively by osmotic and phoretic effects and activated by light. We measured a transition from normal to giant-number fluctuations. Our experiments are quantitatively described by simple numerical simulations. We show that the existence of the living crystals is intrinsically related to the out-of-equilibrium collisions of the self-propelled particles.},

	abstractnote = {The motility mechanism of certain rod-shaped bacteria has long been a mystery, since no external appendages are involved in their motion which is known as gliding. However, the physical principles behind gliding motility still remain poorly understood. Using myxobacteria as a canonical example of such organisms, we identify here the physical principles behind gliding motility, and develop a theoretical model that predicts a two-regime behavior of the gliding speed as a function of the substrate stiffness. Our theory describes the elastic, viscous, and capillary interactions between the bacterial membrane carrying a traveling wave, the secreted slime acting as a lubricating film, and the substrate which we model as a soft solid. Defining the myxobacterial gliding as the horizontal motion on the substrate under zero net force, we find the two-regime behavior is due to two different mechanisms of motility thrust. On stiff substrates, the thrust arises from the bacterial shape deformations creating a flow of slime that exerts a pressure along the bacterial length. This pressure in conjunction with the bacterial shape provides the necessary thrust for propulsion. However, we show that such a mechanism cannot lead to gliding on very soft substrates. Instead, we show that capillary effects lead to the formation of a ridge at the slime-substrate-air interface, which creates a thrust in the form of a localized pressure gradient at the tip of the bacteria. To test our theory, we perform experiments with isolated cells on agar substrates of varying stiffness and find the measured gliding speeds to be in good agreement with the predictions from our elasto-capillary-hydrodynamic model. The physical mechanisms reported here serve as an important step towards an accurate theory of friction and substrate-mediated interaction between bacteria in a swarm of cells proliferating in soft media.},

	abstract = {Active matter systems, and in particular the cell cytoskeleton, exhibit complex mechanochemical dynamics that are still not well understood. While prior computational models of cytoskeletal dynamics have lead to many conceptual insfile:///C:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/3208633.zipights, an important niche still needs to be filled with a high-resolution structural modeling framework, which includes a minimally-complete set of cytoskeletal chemistries, stochastically treats reaction and diffusion processes in three spatial dimensions, accurately and efficiently describes mechanical deformations of the filamentous network under stresses generated by molecular motors, and deeply couples mechanics and chemistry at high spatial resolution. To address this need, we propose a novel reactive coarse-grained force field, as well as a publicly available software package, named the Mechanochemical Dynamics of Active Networks (MEDYAN), for simulating active network evolution and dynamics (available at www.medyan.org). This model can be used to study the non-linear, far from equilibrium processes in active matter systems, in particular, comprised of interacting semi-flexible polymers embedded in a solution with complex reaction-diffusion processes. In this work, we applied MEDYAN to investigate a contractile actomyosin network consisting of actin filaments, alpha-actinin cross-linking proteins, and non-muscle myosin IIA mini-filaments. We found that these systems undergo a switch-like transition in simulations from a random network to ordered, bundled structures when cross-linker concentration is increased above a threshold value, inducing contraction driven by myosin II mini-filaments. Our simulations also show how myosin II mini-filaments, in tandem with cross-linkers, can produce a range of actin filament polarity distributions and alignment, which is crucially dependent on the rate of actin filament turnover and the actin filament's resulting super-diffusive behavior in the actomyosin-cross-linker system. We discuss the biological implications of these findings for the arc formation in lamellipodium-to-lamellum architectural remodeling. Lastly, our simulations produce force-dependent accumulation of myosin II, which is thought to be responsible for their mechanosensation ability, also spontaneously generating myosin II concentration gradients in the solution phase of the simulation volume.},

	abstract = {Living systems naturally exhibit internal driving: active, molecular processes drive non-equilibrium phenomena such as metabolism or migration. Active gels constitute a fascinating class of internally driven matter, in which molecular motors exert localized stresses inside polymer networks. There is evidence that network crosslinking is required to allow motors to induce macroscopic contraction. Yet a quantitative understanding of how network connectivity enables contraction is lacking. Here we show experimentally that myosin motors contract crosslinked actin polymer networks to clusters with a scale-free size distribution. This critical behaviour occurs over an unexpectedly broad range of crosslink concentrations. To understand this robustness, we developed a quantitative model of contractile networks that takes into account network restructuring: motors reduce connectivity by forcing crosslinks to unbind. Paradoxically, to coordinate global contractions, motor activity should be low. Otherwise, motors drive initially well-connected networks to a critical state where ruptures form across the entire network.},

	abstract = {Cells assemble numerous types of actomyosin bundles that generate contractile forces for biological processes, such as cytokinesis and cell migration. One example of contractile bundles is a transverse arc that forms via actomyosin-driven condensation of actin filaments in the lamellipodia of migrating cells and exerts significant forces on the surrounding environments. Structural reorganization of a network into a bundle facilitated by actomyosin contractility is a physiologically relevant and biophysically interesting process. Nevertheless, it remains elusive how actin filaments are reoriented, buckled, and bundled as well as undergo tension buildup during the structural reorganization. In this study, using an agent-based computational model, we demonstrated how the interplay between the density of myosin motors and cross-linking proteins and the rigidity, initial orientation, and turnover of actin filaments regulates the morphological transformation of a cross-linked actomyosin network into a bundle and the buildup of tension occurring during the transformation.},

	abstract = {Microtubules and motor proteins self-organize into biologically important assemblies including the mitotic spindle and the centrosomal microtubule array. Outside of cells, microtubule-motor mixtures can form novel active liquid-crystalline materials driven out of equilibrium by adenosine triphosphate-consuming motor proteins. Microscopic motor activity causes polarity-dependent interactions between motor proteins and microtubules, but how these interactions yield larger-scale dynamical behavior such as complex flows and defect dynamics is not well understood. We develop a multiscale theory for microtubule-motor systems in which Brownian dynamics simulations of polar microtubules driven by motors are used to study microscopic organization and stresses created by motor-mediated microtubule interactions. We identify polarity-sorting and crosslink tether relaxation as two polar-specific sources of active destabilizing stress. We then develop a continuum Doi-Onsager model that captures polarity sorting and the hydrodynamic flows generated by these polar-specific active stresses. In simulations of active nematic flows on immersed surfaces, the active stresses drive turbulent flow dynamics and continuous generation and annihilation of disclination defects. The dynamics follow from two instabilities, and accounting for the immersed nature of the experiment yields unambiguous characteristic length and time scales. When turning off the hydrodynamics in the Doi-Onsager model, we capture formation of polar lanes as observed in the Brownian dynamics simulation.},

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are used to study two-dimensional hard rod fluids consisting of spherocylinders confined to lie in a plane. The phase behavior is mapped out as a function of the aspect ratio (L/D) of the particles, from the hard disc limit at one extreme (L/D=0) to the thin hard needle limit at the other (L/D=infinity). For long rods, a 2D nematic phase is observed at high density in which the orientational correlation functions decay algebraically, indicating that the phase does not possess true long range orientational order. The simulation data indicate that the transition from this phase to the low density isotropic phase is continuous, via a Kosterlitz-Thouless disclination unbinding type mechanism, rather than first order. For short rods the nematic phase disappears so that, on expansion, the solid phase undergoes a first order transition directly to an isotropic phase. Although the latter phase is globally isotropic, we find evidence for strong local positional and orientational correlations between the particles. Where possible, the simulation results are compared and contrasted to experimental, simulation and theoretical data for other two-dimensional liquid crystalline systems.

Hydrodynamic turbulence acts on even larger scales and is dominated by inertial transport of energy. Using an established modification of the Navier-Stokes equation that accounts for the small scale forcing of hydrodynamic flow by microswimmers, we study the properties of a dense supensions of microswimmers in two dimensions, where the conservation of enstrophy can drive an inverse cascade through which energy is accumulated on the largest scales. We find that the dynamical and statistical properties of the flow show a sharp transition to the formation of vortices at the largest length scale. The results show that 2d bacterial and hydrodynamic turbulence are separated by a subcritical phase transition.},

Because of the complex relationship between individual laws and system-level behaviour, theory is needed to assess which emergent phenomena result from fine-tuning or adaptation, and which follow from logical or physical constraints set by the system's design. Here we illustrate this crucial role of theory through recent examples from the collective motion of bird flocks. In some cases abstract theoretical laws explain the emergence of some apparently surprising traits, without the need to invoke new assumptions. Conversely, quantitative theoretical predictions sometimes show that general mathematical and physical laws are incompatible with otherwise mundane observations, forcing us to reconsider our assumptions and leading us to discover new principles.},

	abstractnote = {The quantitative characterization of the microstructure of random heterogeneous media in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $mathbb{R}^d$ via a variety of $n$-point correlation functions is of great importance, since the respective infinite set determines the effective physical properties of the media. In particular, surface-surface $F_{ss}$ and surface-void $F_{sv}$ correlation functions (obtainable from radiation scattering experiments) contain crucial interfacial information that enables one to estimate transport properties of the media (e.g., the mean survival time and fluid permeability) and complements the information content of the conventional two-point correlation function. However, the current technical difficulty involved in sampling surface correlation functions has been a stumbling block in their widespread use. We first present a concise derivation of the small-$r$ behaviors of these functions, which are linked to the textit{mean curvature} of the system. Then we demonstrate that one can reduce the computational complexity of the problem by extracting the necessary interfacial information from a cut of the system with an infinitely long line. Accordingly, we devise algorithms based on this idea and test them for two-phase media in continuous and discrete spaces. Specifically for the exact benchmark model of overlapping spheres, we find excellent agreement between numerical and exact results. We compute surface correlation functions and corresponding local surface-area variances for a variety of other model microstructures, including hard spheres in equilibrium, decorated ``stealthy'' patterns, as well as snapshots of evolving pattern formation processes (e.g., spinodal decomposition). It is demonstrated that the precise determination of surface correlation functions provides a powerful means to characterize a wide class of complex multiphase microstructures.},

In thermal equilibrium, the pressure depends only on bulk properties (density, temperature, etc.) through an equation of state. Here we show that in active systems containing self-propelled particles, the pressure instead can depend on the precise interactions between the system's contents and its confining walls. Generic active fluids therefore have no equation of state. We show how one is recovered in certain limiting cases, which include "active Brownian spheres", a much-studied simplified model of self-propelled particles. Even in these cases, the mechanical pressure can exhibit anomalous properties that defy the familiar thermodynamic description of passive fluid materials.},

	abstractnote = {Swarming colonies of the light responsive bacteria Serratia marcescens grown on agar exhibit robust fluctuating large-scale collective flows that include arrayed vortices, jets, and sinuous streamers. We study the immobilization and quenching of these large-scale flows when the moving swarm is exposed to light with a substantial ultra-violet component. We map the response to light in terms of two independent parameters - the light intensity and duration of exposure and identify the conditions under which mobility is affected significantly. For small exposure times and/or low intensities, we find collective mobility to be negligibly affected. Increasing exposure times and/or intensity to higher values temporarily suppresses collective mobility. Terminating exposure allows bacteria regain motility and eventually reestablish large scale flows. For long exposure times or at high intensities, exposed bacteria become paralyzed, with macroscopic speeds eventually reducing to zero. In this process, they form highly aligned, jammed domains. Individual domains eventually coalesce into a large macroscopic domain with mean radial extent growing as the square root of exposure time. Post exposure, active bacteria dislodge exposed bacteria from these jammed configurations; initial dissolution rates are found to be strongly dependent on duration of exposure suggesting that caging effects are substantial at higher exposure times. Based on our experimental observations, we propose a minimal Brownian dynamics model to examine the escape of exposed bacteria from the region of exposure. Our results complement studies on planktonic bacteria and inform models for pattern formation in gradated illumination.},

However, the purely nematic alignment suppresses the rectification for large self-propulsion speed and slightly facilitates the rectification for small self-propulsion speed. With an increase in the relative weight of polar interactions, the rectified eciency is suddenly increased from 0--1, with the jump depending on the order switching from nematic to polar. From the point of view of dynamic ordering, we can conclude that the perfect polarly ordered phase will cause the maximal rectified eciency, while the genuine apolarly ordered phase will suppress the rectification.},

As a function of orbit radius, we find a divergence in the number of cycles required to reach a collision-free steady state at a critical radius, while above this radius, the system remains in a fluctuating liquid state. For high densities, the system can organize into a fully phase separated state that is mostly reversible, but collisions at the boundaries between the phases lead to a net transport of disks along the boundary edges in a direction determined by the chirality of the active disk orbits. We map the dynamic phases as a function of density and orbit radii and discuss the results in terms of the reversible-irreversible transition found in other periodically driven non-thermal systems.

For weak confinements, multiple continuously nucleating and annihilating topological defects self-organize into persistent circular flows of either handedness. Increasing confinement strength leads to the emergence of distinct dynamics, in which the slow periodic nucleation of topological defects at the boundary is superimposed onto a fast procession of a pair of defects. A defect pair migrates towards the confinement core over multiple rotation cycles, while the associated nematic director field evolves from a distinct double spiral towards a nearly circularly symmetric configuration. The collapse of the defect orbits is punctuated by another boundary-localized nucleation event, that sets up long-term doubly-periodic dynamics. Comparing experimental data to a theoretical model of an active nematic, reveals that theory captures the fast procession of a pair of $+frac{1}{2}$ defects, but not the slow spiral transformation nor the periodic nucleation of defect pairs. Theory also fails to predict the emergence of circular flows in the weak confinement regime. The developed confinement methods are generalized to more complex geometries, providing a robust microfluidic platform for rationally engineering two-dimensional autonomous flows.},

	abstract = {We study collections of self-propelled rods (SPR) moving in two dimensions for packing fractions less than or equal to 0.3. We find that in the thermodynamical limit the SPR undergo a phase transition between a disordered gas and a novel phase-separated system state. Interestingly, (global) orientational order patterns -- contrary to what has been suggested -- vanish in this limit. In the found novel state, the SPR self-organize into a highly dynamical, high-density, compact region - which we call aggregate - which is surrounded by a disordered gas. Active stresses build inside aggregates as result of the combined effect of local orientational order and active forces. This leads to the most distinctive feature of these aggregates: constant ejection of polar clusters of SPR. This novel phase-separated state represents a novel state of matter characterized by large fluctuations in volume and shape, related to mass ejection, and exhibits positional as well as orientational local order. SPR systems display new physics unseen in other active matter systems due to the coupling between density, active stresses, and orientational order (such coupling cannot be reduced simply to a coupling between speed and density).},

Such patterns have mainly been explored for identical circle swimmers, while real-world circle swimmers, typically possess a frequency distribution. Here we show that even the simplest mixture of (velocity-aligning) circle swimmers with two different frequencies, hosts a complex world of superstructures: The most remarkable example comprises a microflock pattern, formed in one species, while the other species phase separates and forms a macrocluster, coexisting with a gas phase. Here, one species microphase-separates and selects a characteristic length scale, whereas the other one macrophase separates and selects a density. A second notable example, here occurring in an isotropic system, are patterns comprising two different characteristic length scales, which are controllable via frequency and swimming speed of the individual particles.},

The simulations demonstrate that the two species spontaneously segregate to generate a rich array of dynamical domain structures whose properties depend on the propulsion velocity, density, and composition. In addition to presenting phase diagrams as a function of the system parameters, we investigate the mechanisms driving segregation. We show that the difference in collision frequencies between self-propelled and passive rods provides a driving force for segregation, which is amplified by the tendency of the self-propelled rods to swarm or cluster. Finally, both self-propelled and passive rods exhibit giant number fluctuations for sufficient propulsion velocities.},

Using a crossbridge model with the assumptions of fast powerstroke kinetics and equal load sharing between equivalent states, we derive a one-step master equation for the activity of a finite-sized ensemble of mechanically coupled myosin II motors. For constant external load, this approach yields analytical results for duty ratio and force-velocity relation as a function of ensemble size. We find that stochastic effects cannot be neglected for ensemble sizes below 15. The one-step master equation can be used also for efficient computer simulations with linear elastic external load and reveals the sequence of build-up of force and ensemble rupture that is characteristic for reconstituted actomyosin contractility.},

	abstract = {Systems of self-propelled particles are known for their tendency to aggregate and to display swarm behavior. We investigate two model systems, self-propelled rods interacting via volume exclusion, and sinusoidally-beating flagella embedded in a fluid with hydrodynamic interactions. In the flagella system, beating frequencies are Gaussian distributed with a non-zero average. These systems are studied by Brownian-dynamics simulations and by mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations, respectively. The clustering behavior is analyzed as the particle density and the environmental or internal noise are varied. By distinguishing three types of cluster-size probability density functions, we obtain a phase diagram of different swarm behaviors. The properties of clusters, such as their configuration, lifetime and average size are analyzed. We find that the swarm behavior of the two systems, characterized by several effective power laws, is very similar. However, a more careful analysis reveals several differences. Clusters of self-propelled rods form due to partially blocked forward motion, and are therefore typically wedge-shaped. At higher rod density and low noise, a giant mobile cluster appears, in which most rods are mostly oriented towards the center. In contrast, flagella become hydrodynamically synchronized and attract each other; their clusters are therefore more elongated. Furthermore, the lifetime of flagella clusters decays more quickly with cluster size than of rod clusters.},

	abstractnote = {The tetrapod appendicular skeleton develops from a cartilage template that is prefigured by spatially patterned condensations of mesenchymal cells. The size and spacing of these condensations in the embryonic limbs of birds are mediated by a reactiondiffusion-adhesion network consisting of the matricellular proteins Gal-1A, Gal-8 and their glycosylated cell surface receptors. In cultures of limb precartilage mesenchymal cells we found that condensations appear simultaneously, which raised the question of how their formation is synchronized across distances greater than the characteristic wavelength of their spatial pattern. Since oscillatory dynamics of Hes1, a downstream target of Notch signaling, are involved in coordinating cell behavior during vertebrate somitogenesis, we explored whether they have a similar role in developing limb bud mesenchyme. Hes1 mRNA underwent oscillations with a periodicity of 6 hours during condensation formation in vitro. A mathematical model for the two-galectin pattern forming network, modified to incorporate periodicity in adhesive response of cells to Gal-1A, predicts that the spatiotemporal regularity of condensation formation is improved if the oscillator phase is synchronized across the culture. Treatment of cultures with DAPT, a pharmacological inhibitor of Notch signaling, led to elevation of both Gal-1A and -8 mRNA levels in vitro and in silico, suggesting that the Notch pathway is integral to the patterning network. DAPT predictably damped Hes1 oscillations and led to irregularly-sized and fused condensations in vitro. In developing limb buds in ovo, it led to spatially non-uniform Hes1 expression and fused and misshapen digits. Finally, the previously described sharpening effect of FGF2 on the condensation pattern was correlated with its enhancement of Hes1 synchronization. Together our experimental and computational results suggest that the two-galectin reaction-diffusion-adhesion network that patterns the avian limb skeleton is regulated by the Notch pathway. Moreover, global coordination of this pathway by synchronization of Hes1 oscillations across the tissue micromass in vitro or the digital plate in vivo refines and regularizes morphogenesis of the skeletal elements.},

@article{Lan2008,
	abstract = {A filopodium is a cytoplasmic projection, exquisitely built and regulated, which extends from the leading edge of the migrating cell, exploring the cell's neighborhood. Commonly, filopodia grow and retract after their initiation, exhibiting rich dynamical behaviors. We model the growth of a filopodium based on a stochastic description which incorporates mechanical, physical, and biochemical components. Our model provides a full stochastic treatment of the actin monomer diffusion and polymerization of each individual actin filament under stress of the fluctuating membrane. We investigated the length distribution of individual filaments in a growing filopodium and studied how it depends on various physical parameters. The distribution of filament lengths turned out to be narrow, which we explained by the negative feedback created by the membrane load and monomeric G-actin gradient. We also discovered that filopodial growth is strongly diminished upon increasing retrograde flow, suggesting that regulating the retrograde flow rate would be a highly efficient way to control filopodial extension dynamics. The filopodial length increases as the membrane fluctuations decrease, which we attributed to the unequal loading of the membrane force among individual filaments, which, in turn, results in larger average polymerization rates. We also observed significant diffusional noise of G-actin monomers, which leads to smaller G-actin flux along the filopodial tube compared with the prediction using the diffusion equation. Overall, partial cancellation of these two fluctuation effects allows a simple mean field model to rationalize most of our simulation results. However, fast fluctuations significantly renormalize the mean field model parameters. The biological significance of our filopodial model and avenues for future development are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

	abstractnote = {The dynamics of dry active matter have implications for a diverse collection of biological phenomena spanning a range of length and time scales, such as animal flocking, cell tissue dynamics, and swarming of inserts and bacteria. Uniting these systems are a common set of symmetries and conservation laws, defining dry active fluids as a class of physical system. Many interesting behaviors have been observed at high densities, which remain difficult to simulate due to the computational demand. Here, we devise a new method to study dry active fluids in a dense regime using a simple modification of the lattice Boltzmann method. We apply our method to an active model with contact inhibition of locomotion, which has relevance to collective cell migration, and uncover multiple novel phase transitions: two first-order and one potentially critical. We further support our simulation results with an analytical treatment of the hydrodynamic equations.},

	abstractnote = {Epithelial cell monolayers show remarkable long-range displacement and velocity correlations reminiscent of supercooled liquids and active nematics. Here we show that many of the observed features can be understood within the framework of active matter at high densities. In particular, we argue that uncoordinated but persistent cell motility coupled to the collective elastic modes of the cell sheet is sufficient to produce characteristic swirl-like correlations. This includes a divergent correlation length in the limit of infinite persistence time. We derive this result using both continuum active linear elasticity and a normal modes formalism, and validate analytical predictions with numerical simulations of two agent-based models of soft elastic particles and in-vitro experiments of confluent corneal epithelial cell sheets. Our analytical model is able to fit measured velocity correlation functions without any free parameters.},

Although the Ising model has been well studied, no analytical result for the spin-spin correlation function exists for arbitrary magnetic fields and temperatures. We show the validity of our form by comparison with simulations using the Wolff algorithm, and obtain remarkable precision by including analytic corrections to scaling. Given recent interest in comparing biomembrane heterogeneity to Ising criticality, our spin-spin correlation function may be used as a predictive quantitative measure for FRET or NMR membrane experiments.},

@article{chepizhko2015active,
	abstract = {We present a detailed study of the large-scale collective properties of self-propelled particles (SPPs) moving in two-dimensional heterogeneous space. The impact of spatial heterogeneities on the ordered, collectively moving phase is investigated. We show that for strong enough spatial heterogeneity, the well-documented high-density, high-ordered propagating bands that emerge in homogeneous space disappear. Moreover, the ordered phase does not exhibit long-range order, as occurs in homogeneous systems, but rather quasi-long range order: i.e. the SPP system becomes disordered in the thermodynamical limit. For finite size systems, we find that there is an optimal noise value that maximizes order. Interestingly, the system becomes disordered in two limits, for high noise values as well as for vanishing noise. This remarkable finding strongly suggests the existence of two critical points, instead of only one, associated to the collective motion transition. Density fluctuations are consistent with these observations, being higher and anomalously strong at the optimal noise, and decreasing and crossing over to normal for high and low noise values. Collective properties are investigated in static as well as dynamic heterogeneous environments, and by changing the symmetry of the velocity alignment mechanism of the SPPs.},

The hydrodynamic equations are obtained from a Boltzmann equation expressed in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics. All their transport coefficients are given with explicit dependences on particle-level parameters. The linear stability analysis of their spatially-homogeneous solutions is presented. While the equations derived for the polar case (original Vicsek model with ferromagnetic alignment) and their solutions do not differ much from their 2D counterparts, the active nematics case exhibits remarkable differences: we find a true discontinuous transition to order with a bistability region, and cholesteric solutions whose stability we discuss.},

Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles--active matter--with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. },
